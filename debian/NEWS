xterm (249-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The default value for 'pointerMode' has changed.  'pointerMode'
  specifies when the pointer may be hidden as the user types.  It will
  be redisplayed if the user moves the mouse, or clicks one of its
  buttons.  Previously the default value was "0" meaning never hide the
  pointer.  The default is now "1" meaning hide the pointer after the
  user has typed, if the xterm has not activated mouse mode.  To
  restore the previous behavior set the X resource XTerm*pointerMode
  to "0".  (e.g. XTerm*pointerMode:0)
