    + fixes to make the internalBorder area not change color due to
      reverseVideo and/or related exposure events.  The latter was a very old

xterm (208-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (patchlevel #208). Main changes follow:
    - Implement logic in termcap query to process multiple parameters as
      documented in ctlseqs.ms
    - Fix buffer size used for termcap query, which was not long enough for
      the terminfo "colors" name.
    - Add menu entry (alt-esc) and corresponding action (alt-sends-esc) to
      toggle the eightBitInput resource setting.
    - Modify computation of rows/columns on resize to avoid extending beyond
      the given limits, e.g., if resizing in response to a "maximize" in
      Gnome or KDE which do not use the window manager hints for this case
      (closes: #289123).
    - Improve error-reporting when chown/chmod of the pseudo-terminal fails.
    - Several changes in the control sequences.
    - Improvements in the configure script.
    - Eliminate a retry for a better-matching bold font, to work around
      recent font server changes.
    - Specify weight for wide font which may be derived from normal
      fontname.
    - Cache the derived wide- and widebolt- fontnames.
    - Modify resource files to make the font-resources a little more specific,
      e.g., changing "*VT100*" to "*VT100.", to make the distinction between
      VT100.font and VT100.utf8Fonts.font sharper, in case a packager modifies
      one of those.
    - Expanded comments in UXTerm.ad regarding the font resources (closes:
      #319179).
    - Add --enable-narrowproto configure option to accommodate Xorg "modular"
      build.
    - Add scrollBarBorder resource.
    - Fix a file-descriptor leak when calling openpty().
    - A hard reset also resets the 132/80 mode.
    - Restore window manager hints after XtMakeResizeRequest() calls.
    - Scroll-down is allowed to be sent while mouse tracking is enabled.
    - Correct size-comparison in HandleInterpret() broken in changes from
      patch #201 to allocate input buffer (closes: #334317).
    - Upstream merged Debian patches 001 and 002 for typos in xterm.
    - Added setuid options.
    - add charClass resource to XTerm.ad and UXTerm.ad which simplifies
      selecting URLs
    - make -iconic option work with toolbar configuration
    - fix memory reallocation for the "UTF-8" menu entry when xterm is started
      using the +u8 option
  * Debian patches 900 and 901 resynced.
  * Clean up xterm.dirs a bit
  * Explicitly call --with-app-defaults (set to /etc/X11/app-defaults) during
    configure

xterm (204-0pre1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The xterm package has been splitted from the upstream X.Org tree, in
    advance of the upcoming modularization in X.Org 7.0.
  * First release to experimental, in order to test if the transition has been
    successful.
  * Credit is given to X Strike Force for their good work over these years,
    keeping a bunch of old entries from current X.Org changelog.
  * Most of the corresponding code has been imported from the X.Org packages.
    Obviously, debian/rules has been revamped and simplified.
  * New upstream release (patchlevel #204).
    - The mere existence of independent packages for xterm eases the
      identification (i.e. xterm's version). Thus it closes: #324352. Also
      added a patch to version.h in the meanwhile to override the "X.Org
      6.8.2" string in the configure script.
    - Work around quirk in shell which allowed user to "run" uxterm script
      when there was no UTF-8 locale installed by entering "sh -x uxterm".
      Also popup an xmessage to show the problem for users who run this via a
      GUI (closes: #318513).
    - Disallow changes to fonts, toolbar and scrollbar when the vt100 window
      is iconified, to simplify management of the active icon.
    - Fixes to make -geom option work properly with the toolbar configuration
      (Gentoo Bugzilla #90717, #91967).
    - Minor improvements to scrollbar layout.
    - Improve initialization due to utf8 resource by loading the utf8Fonts
      resource in the case where locale resource is false. Also in this case,
      do not disable switching UTF-8 mode on/off.
    - Minor optimization of TrueType font-loading. Load italic font only
      when needed.
    - Correct variable used to store temporary result from lookup of bold
      font, when initializing the wide-bold-font data and no immediate match
      is found by asking for a bold variant of the wide-font. The result was
      to use overstriking rather than the actual bold font (this is the fix
      for #318162, patch by Eugene Konev).
    - Modify initialization of allowSendEvents and allowWindowOps to prevent
      modification with the editres protocol.
    - Add support for interpreting the underline attribute as an italic font
      in Xft mode (patch by Chuck Blake).
    - Improve initialization of toolbar.
    - Fix logic in find_utmp, which did not reset result in getutid(),
      causing an infinite loop in some conditions.
    - Set the _NET_WM_PID property.
    - Change default values for minBufSize and maxBufSize to 4096 and 32768
      respectively so that the initial read request will match the value from
      before changes to use sched_yield().
    - Make paste of UTF-8 faster for Western character sets by checking range
      of incoming data.
    - Added experimental option to allow applications to get or set the
      selection data.
    - Fix an off-by-one error parsing -S/nn option (closes: #311438, thanks to
      Peter Chubb).
    - Fix an initialization bug from patch #201 that broke logging.
    - Amend change to command-line processing in patch #201 to avoid conflict
      with -e option (closes: #318280).
  * debian/control: Removed Conflicts with xbase << 3.3.3.2whatever, and
    suidmanager << 0.50. They are not even in Sarge.
  * The patch structure is basicly the same as in X.Org. The corresponding
    patches from X.Org patch tree have been extracted. Added a change in the
    .TH field of the manpage in order to shut up lintian.
  * Added --enable-256-color to configure (closes: #305540).
  * Moved away things from /usr/X11R6/ to /usr, now that we are free of
    imake's shackles. As a bonus, it removes several lintian warnings. Renamed
    things in debian/xterm.{postinst,prerm}.
  * Added an override file for lintian warning about setgid in xterm.
  * The postinst script is now fixed, and it points to correct manpages
    (closes: #315195).

       and m68k
     - Fix incorrect C++ ABI transition. libglu1-xorg is implemented in C++

   - Pull the following from Ubuntu Breezy patches to allow gcc4 builds
     - 024d_radeon_fix_gcc4_build.diff (to which I incorporated a one-line fix
       from the 024a_radeon_benh_fixes.diff patch)
     - 991_ubuntu_gcc_flags.diff

    - Package name changes for the C++ ABI transition: (Thanks to Eugene Konev,
      Steve Langasek, and Daniel Stone)
      - xlibmesa-glu renamed to libglu1-xorg; Provides: changed to
        libglu1c2, libglu1c2 added to the Conflicts: and Replaces:
      - libglu1-xorg shlibs changed to libglu1-xorg | libglu1c2
      - xlibmesa-glu-dbg renamed to libglu1-xorg-dbg; xlibmesa-glu-dbg
        added to Conflicts: and Replaces:
      - xlibmesa-glu-dev renamed to libglu1-xorg-dev; depend on
        libglu1-xorg instead of xlibmesa-glu, of course, and add
        xlibmesa-glu-dev to the Conflicts/Replaces/Provides
      - Update x-window-system-core to depend on libglu1-xorg instead of
        xlibmesa-glu
      - Update x-window-system-dev to depend on libglu1-xorg-{dev,dbg}
        instead of xlibmesa-glu-{dev,dbg}
      - Drop the xlibmesa3, xlibmesa3-dbg, and xlibmesa-dev transition
        packages; these existed for the woody->sarge transition, and they
        can't possibly provide a proper transition for anything that
        relies on the C++ ABI, so better to get rid of them altogether
      - Rename all xlibmesa-glu package files accordingly

    - Remove libglu1-xorg-dev's dependency on "libstdc++5-3.3-dev |
      libstdc++-dev": this doesn't actually ensure that the correct C++
      headers are installed, and it's no longer the correct libstdc++
      version anyway.

    - Add patch 915_disable_i915_debugging.diff, to disable non-x86 debug
      statements for this chip. Thanks to Aaron M. Ucko

        properly with no fuzz

  * Update FAQ to refer to X.Org instead of freedesktop.org where appropriate.
    (Closes: #309811)

  * Change xorg-common to x-common

  * Update lsb-base version requirement to 3.0-1

  Changes by Branden Robinson:

  * Initial release, based upon upstream CVS tag XORG-6_8_2.  See
    debian/copyright for details of material removed due to overlap with
    existing Debian packaging or license terms that fail to satisfy the DFSG.

  * Explain build-dependencies and build-conflicts in debian/control comments.

  * Update build-dependencies relative to xfree86 4.3.0.dfsg.1-12:
    + List upstream build dependencies on commands first, followed by
      upstream build depenencies on library headers, and then Debian packaging
      infrastructure dependencies.
    + Remove no-longer needed build dependencies on libfontconfig1-dev (header
      files not used), libpaperg (superseded by libpaper1, and depended upon
      by tetex-bin nowadays), linux-kernel-headers (depended on by
      build-essential package libc6-dev), bzip2 and dbs (new organization of
      source package will not require these).

  * Backport fixes from upstream CVS trunk:
    + Shut up (tons of) Imake warnings on Debian systems by testing for
      variable being defined before testing its value.  (Presumably the
      fallback definition of NothingOutsideProjectRoot in Imake.tmpl was
      intended to prevent this, but it apparently is not in effect yet
      when linux.cf is parsed.)
    + Fix CAN-2005-0605: scan.c in the Xpm library may allow attackers to
      execute arbitrary code via a negative bitmap_unit value that leads
      to a buffer overflow. (see Debian #298939)

  * Update debian/copyright to correctly document source package name, origin
    of .orig.tar.gz file, and credit David Nusinow as a package author.
    Restore removal of credits to Stephen Early, Mark Eichin, and ISHIKAWA
    Mutsumi as package authors.  Alter Debian "fallback" copyright notice to
    credit copyright from changes in 1996 to Stephen Early, in 1997 to Mark
    Eichin, and for the years since to Branden Robinson.  In the U.S., a
    written instrument is required to transfer copyright, and to the best of
    my knowledge, none of Stephen, Mark, or myself ever signed such an
    instrument.  Remove anti-publicity clause from Debian fallback copyright
    notice as it's not part of the original MIT/X11 license from the 1980s and
    has no force under U.S. copyright law (asserting copyright in something,
    even Free Software, doesn't waive a person's publicity rights anyway).
    Remove duplicate Debian copyright notice for Software in the Public
    Interest, Inc.  Merge change from Debian xfree86 SVN to stop identifying
    the Compugraphic and Adobe fonts from the Xprint server as non-DFSG-free;
    the files have been removed from the upstream archive for another reason,
    namely the existence of the xprint package.

  * Place Ubuntu package changelog entries in changelog.Ubuntu (as they do not
    actually reflect package release history as a Debian user would see it).
    Ship this changelog in /usr/share/doc/xorg-common.

  * Add debian/scripts/missing-keyword-sniffer, which identifies plain text
    files in the source package that are missing Subversion Id keywords or the
    corresponding property.

  * Rework source package to consist of an unpacked source tree, instead of
    shipping a .tar.gz inside the .orig.tar.gz.
    + Add debian/scripts/up-scripts (called automatically by dbs's "setup"
      target), which copies the source tree into build-tree using hardlinks.
    + Update debian/setperms to ensure that up-scripts is executable.
    + Update debian/vars to stop defining SOURCE_DIR variable.
    + Put debian/scripts in PATH and export it from debian/rules, so that dbs
      can find up-scripts.
    + Update target dependencies in debian/rules from "$(patched)" to "setup",
      so that we can be sure up-scripts is run.

  * Make .orig.tar.gz preparation less opaque.
    + Add prune-upstream-tree and make-orig-tar-gz phony targets to
      debian/rules.  (Note that these are not intended for ordinary package
      builds, and have to be manually invoked.)
    + Remove outdated and now-obsolete file debian/scripts/prune-non-free.
    + Add $(SOURCE_NAME) and $(UPSTREAM_VERSION) variables to debian/rules.

  * Update paths to files containg sourceless firmware in debian/copyright.

  * Grab patches from upstream CVS HEAD:
    - Add radeon(4x) manpage updates documenting VGAAccess, ReverseDDC, and
      LVDSProbePLL options.  (Benjamin Herrenschmidt)
      <URL: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2064 >.
    - Add VGAAccess option to r128 driver, based on Benjamin Herrenscmidts's
      radeon patch.  r128 should now work on PowerPCs without "UseFBDev".  To
      use this on PowerPC, make sure you set "UseFBDev" to "false".
      (Alex Deucher)
      <URL: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2089 >.

  * Document DFSG-non-freeness of PolyglotMan ("rman") in debian/copyright.

  * Update patch #058 to give Xcomposite, Xdamage, Xevie, and Xfixes their own
    copies of the config-subst script, instead of hard-coding a within-tree
    path to the copy in the Xcursor library.  (I don't know what the point of
    directing these Imakefiles over to Xcursor's copy was -- there were
    already four identical copies of config-subst in X.Org 6.8.2 anyway, so
    this decision didn't help matters much. :) ) Update the Imakefiles to look
    for config-subst in the current working directory instead of ../Xcursor.
    Convert local includes to system includes in the GLU library and X server
    so that the RENDER protocol headers can actually be found.  Define
    RenderDefines if either BuildRender or HaveRenderLibrary is true, not just
    BuildRender.  Only specify render.h and renderproto.h as targets and
    install renderproto.h as part of the SDK if we're building the extension
    and *don't* have the extension library in the build environment.  Update
    MANIFEST.*.in files to reflect the fact that render.h and renderproto.h
    are no longer installed.

  * Stop removing the debian/local/xlibmesa-drm-source directory in
    debian/rules's clean target, as nothing creates it, and nothing has since
    xfree86 4.3.0-0pre1v3.

  * Add build-dependency on render-dev (>> 1:0.9), since several files
    directly #include render.h and renderproto.h.  Version dependency since
    symbols new to renderext 0.9 are used.  Document dependency in detail in
    debian/control comments.

  * Update patch #908 to stop attempting to install the sourceless microcode
    files associated with the rendition driver, which are not part of the
    source package (see debian/copyright).  Correct
    debian/MANIFEST.{alpha,amd64,hurd-i386,i386,ia64,sparc}.in to reflect the
    absence of these files.  (Other architectures do not build the rendition
    driver.)  Thanks to Jesus Climent for spotting this problem.
